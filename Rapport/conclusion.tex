\chapter{Conclusion}
To build such a system on top of existing blockchains such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, may result in a costly system, due to relatively large transactions fees and many, low-value transactions in the microgrid network. Ethereum, in addition, requires Ether to run applications/smart contracts on the EVM. Using the modular blockchain of Hyperledger might be a better idea, however - some cost?

The blockchain implemented in this thesis is able to run and process all transactions in the network at no additional cost.

Consortium - node ids are linked to identities - if a node tries to attack the blockchain, its identity will be known and actions may be taken thereafter. 

Transparency - account owners can at any time review there account actions. Super user can see everything

Problem - all users can review all other users account activity through the blockchain ledger - however it is a rigorous task to read all account activity from the ledger. Thus, the application layer exist to make it easier to monitor account activity - and this is only available to the account owner.
