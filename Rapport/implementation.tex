Class for blocks

Class for blockchain

Class for transactions

hashlib.sha256 for hashes 

%simple HTTP server so that any user can let our nodes know that a new transaction has occurred. A node will be able to accept a POST request with a transaction (like above) as the request body. This is why transactions are JSON formatted; we need them to be transmitted to our server in a request body.

Socket vs HTTP

TCP/UDP - UDP would be preferred in local LAN, could make WLAN for blockchain in finite area, but TCP for more general implementation 

%TCP sockets in implementation

Server class with one thread for each incoming connection
Server acts as system master. Continuously broadcasts IP after becoming master. When others connect to the system and discover the master, they are initialized as clients. 

If a master dies or disconnects, there is an election for a new master between the remaining nodes. 

All nodes are aware of other peers in the system. All nodes broadcast presence? 

If two masters (e.g. in two different subsystems), the master with the longest chain will be elected when the subsystems are reconnected
