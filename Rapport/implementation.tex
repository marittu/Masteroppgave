\chapter{Implementation}

Class for blocks

Class for blockchain

Class for transactions

hashlib.sha256 for hashes 


Socket vs HTTP

TCP/UDP - UDP would be preferred in local LAN, could make WLAN for blockchain in finite area, but TCP for more general implementation 

\section{Network Communication}
Peer to Peer network implemented with Python framework Twisted. Asynchronous. Event based. The initial node starts a server, all other nodes starts a server and a client connecting to the initial or another server. Connection starts with a hello-message, and receives information about other peers connected to the network. Each node stores two peer lists, one in the client object and one in the server object (move peers outside of module to create combined peer list for server and client)
