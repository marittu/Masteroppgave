Ideally test over Ethernet/several computers - at least communication protocol

unittest for blocks, ideally for consensus and communication, but not prioritized because of time limitations

table for time it takes to elect leader, based on number of nodes
how long does it take to reach 1000 transaction/blocks
How big is the file with 1000 blocks
