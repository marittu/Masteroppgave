\chapter{Discussion}
Possible to add one more message type - ack propose block and commit several blocks to the blockchain at a time and at longer intervals
Correctness
Strong Consistency
Efficiency - update log is very inefficient
Store all peers since finite size of network?
No protection against brute force attacks on network IP/port 
\section{Conclusion}

\section{Future Work}
Current implementation stores blockchain and other logs locally on machine, a future improvement could be to store the data in the cloud to save space. (Crashes, but not so relevant since data is duplicated across the network)

To save space, blocks containing transactions that are settled or smart contracts that are no longer valid can be deleted.
