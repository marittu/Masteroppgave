\chapter*{Preface}
This paper is submitted on partial fulfillment of the requirements for the Master of Science degree at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU).

The problem description for this thesis was given by supervisor Geir Mathisen, who has also provided helpful guidance in the system development, especially with regard to understanding the problem description and development of functional specifications.

The system was implemented and tested on a standard PC, using Python. Several Python libraries were used in the implementation. These were \textit{Twisted, Flask, ECDSA, and datetime}, as well as the Python standard libraries \textit{os, csv, hashlib, uuid, random, pickle, json, time, and struct}. The implementation of the consensus model and the blockchain are based on findings from the background chapter.
